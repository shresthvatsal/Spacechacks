No Internet
## What it does 👨‍🚀
No Internet is an engaging side-strafing game inspired by the Chrome Dino game. The concept behind the game is to provide an entertaining experience while also incorporating educational elements. The game takes inspiration from the offline page of Chrome, where users encounter a dinosaur when there is no internet connectivity.

## ⚙ Getting Started🚀
To start playing the game, simply click on the "Play" button on the homepage. The homepage replicates the offline page of Chrome, creating a familiar and nostalgic experience. Once you click the "Play" button, you will be taken to the game page.

## 🔧 Game Mechanics👨‍🚀
The game mechanics are similar to the Chrome Dino game, with a twist. Instead of controlling a dinosaur, you control various miniatures like astronauts, caterpillars, and more. These miniatures change periodically as you progress through the game, adding visual variety and excitement.

## 💪 The objective🚀 ![h4](https://github.com/xvisierra/Spacechacks/blob/master/images/game2.png)

The No Internet game aims to continue evolving and improving. Some of the future plans include:

Storing user scores and implementing a leaderboard to showcase the highest scorers.
